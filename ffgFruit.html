                        <h5>Apples are a fruit tree that need a certain number of chill hours in order to set fruit. These will only grow well in north and northern central Florida.


                            Growing apples is relatively new to Florida. A low chill hour variety of apple right now is about 300-400 chill hours. This isn't a possibility for lower central and south Florida.</h5>
                            <h5>Florida Friendly Apple Varieties: Anna, Dorsett Golden, and Tropic Sweet. If growing from seed your tree will take some time in order to produce fruit. It usually takes seed grown trees anywhere from 6-10 years to begin producing fruit. If you have a grafted tree they will produce at a much younger age. Usually between 3-5 years old.
                                
                                Apples normally ripen in Florida around June or July.</h5>

                       <h5>Avocados are like the opposite of apples. They prefer warm weather and don't really like the cold. However, there are new cold tolerant varieties being made that allow north Florida gardeners the chance to grow them.</h5>


                        <h5>Florida Friendly Avocado Varieties: Bernicker, Brogdon, Choquette, Day, Hall, Lula, Marcu Pumpkin, Mexicola, Monroe, Pollack, Russel, Simmonds, Winter.
                        
                        Brogdon, Choquette, Day, Mexicola, and Winter all have a high cold tolerance. This means that they can withstand temperatures in between 20-30&#176;F.
                        
                        The trees must be mature in order to withstand these temps. It’s a good idea to give young Avocado trees plenty of cover when cold weather rolls in.
                        
                        Avocado trees can grow up to 60 feet tall depending on the variety but it becomes rather hard to pick the fruit when trees are that tall. Keeping them at a manageable size with pruning is a good idea.

                   <h5>The fruits actually don't ripen on the tree. The best avocado will ripen in about 4 days after picking. If your avocado rots before it feels ready for eating that means that the fruit needs to stay on the tree a little longer.The time at which they ripen will depending on the variety of avocado tree. You can get multiple varieties of avocado so that you can have a continuous harvest of this great fruit.</h5>

                            Banana plants enjoy our warm and moist summer. They are a tropical plant. The best to time plant a new banana tree in Florida is mid to late spring when the weather warms up and afternoon storms become regular.</h5>
                            <h5>There are lots of different varieties of banana. The ones in the supermarket are usually just one or two different kinds. Bananas come in lots of different colors and sizes.

                                Florida Friendly Banana Varieties: Apple, Blue Java, Dwarf Cavendish, Dwarf Orinoco, Dwarf Red, Gold Finger, Ice Cream, Lady Finger, Mysore, Williams.
                                
                                
                                Ice cream bananas are really cold resistant, Those in north Florida will probably have the best luck with those.
                                
                                Different varieties will grow to different heights. the dwarf varieties will usually grow between 6-9 feet while the other varieties can get up to 14 feet tall.
                                
                                All bananas enjoy full sun and well draining soil. If their roots stay soaked they will die.

                        Guava is native to tropical America, so it grows well in south Florida and central Florida. North Florida's cold weather will kill this tree. Temperatures lower than 27F will kill a mature guava.
                        
                        Fruit production and plant growth stops at 60F. Guava trees can grow up to 12-15 tall and wide.
                        
                        There are two types of guava fruits, pink/red and white guava. White varieties are a little more tart than pink guava. Pink guava is sweet and extremely fragrant when ripe.</h5><br>

                    You should also pick a spot where your guava gets plenty of sun. Guava trees do not do well in part shade, you will get much more fruit from a tree that is grown with plenty of sunshine.

                            Loquats are not only a great fruit producing tree in Florida but they are relatively care free and they are a very attractive landscape plant as well. This makes the loqaut one of the best fruit trees to grow in Florida.</h5>
                            <h5>The best way to grow a loquat tree is from a grafted plant.

                                A loquat tree grown from seed will be slightly different than the tree the seed came from. The fruits may be slightly different or it may produce less fruit. Growing from seed also takes significantly longer to produce fruit. If grown from seed, your plant will not produce fruit until at least year 8. With grafted loquats, you can get fruit with a plant that is 2-3 years old.

                                However loquat seedlings aren’t all bad. seeds sprout easy and they are fine for ornamental uses. These loquats are also perfect for root stock.</h5>

           <h5>The two most popular varieties in Florida are Brewster and Mauritius. Mauritius produces more fruit than the brewster variety.

            Lychees do not grow true from seed. The most common commercial way of making new lychee trees is by air layering.</h5>

                    mango tree in north Florida if you plant in a large container are diligent enough
                    to bring it into a greenhouse or protected area when nights get cold. You can also try protecting your mango by planting it in an area close to the south side of a building
                    and by planting a nice layer of plants around it to protect it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Mature trees can take temperatures down to 25&#176;F but younger trees will be killed by temperatures lower
                    than 30&#176;F. Avoid planting mangoes during the coldest time of the year.</h5>

                <h5>Papayas are really interesting fruits in terms of texture and flavor. They are often compared to cantaloupes in terms of flavor and texture.

                 As far as growing papayas you might not find an easier fruit tree to grow in Florida. Provided with enough water and plenty of sun you will have no problem growing papayas in central and south Florida.</h5><br>
                 <h5>Papayas are damaged by light frosts, they can be grown in containers as long as they are at least 30 inches in diameter. So those in north Florida could potentially grow papayas if you had the ability to protect a large potted plant during the winter.

                Papaya plants normally grow about 10-15 feet tall and produce fruit for about 4 years. After that fruit production begins to decline.
                
                Papaya plants can be Male, Female or both Male and female. The female plants bear the fruit, but need pollination. If you are growing from seed its best to plant more than one plant in order to increase your chance for both sexes.
                
                If buying from a nursery they will probably know the sex of the plant.</h5>

                <h5>Peaches are another fruit tree that requires a certain number of chill hours in order to set fruit.


            There are a number of varieties that are Florida friendly and require a low number of chill hours. North Florida will have no problem growing any of these peach trees. Central Florida will have to be pickier when it comes to which variety they can grow. Those in deep south Florida may be out of luck until we can make no chill hour variety peaches.</h5><br>

            <h5>But your location may vary.

                Never say never. 
                
                Florida Glo and Florida Prince are low chill hour peach varieties that will do well in most parts of the state. These varieties will need 150 chill hours to set fruit.
                UF Best is an even lower chill hour variety needing only 100 chilly hours.
                There are other varieties of peach trees that can be grown in Florida but I think these three mentioned will do well for the majority of the state.</h5>
            
                <h5>Peaches enjoy full sun and a well draining soil. Peaches do require a little pruning in order to maximize fruit production. Trimming them into a vase like structure gives you the best opportunity for lots and lots of fruit.</h5>

                <h5>Florida strawberries can be planted in home gardens beginning in the fall and enjoyed through the winter and spring.

                    Currently <i>Camarosa, Sweet Sensation</i>, and <i>Festival</i> varieties are recommended for Florida home gardens. All varieties produce berries for fresh eating or freezing. <i>Camarosa</i> is best for North Florida, <i>Festival</i> for Central.
                    
                    Growing strawberries requires temperatures between 50&degF - 80&degF and less than 14 hours of daylight for the strawberries to flower and produce fruit. In Florida, these conditions occur throughout the fall, winter, and spring.
                    
                    Strawberries in Florida are planted in September to early November, and flowering and fruit continue through April or May. Fruit set will not be constant, but will have two or three cycles, and can be interrupted by freezes.</h5>
                    
                    <br><h5>Grow strawberries in a full-sun location with at least 8 hours of direct sunlight. You can plant strawberries in rows in raised beds or in planter boxes, pots, or other containers. Just make sure your planting spot has good drainage.

                        Before planting, mix in two pounds of a fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium per 10 feet of soil.
                        
                        Use transplants for planting; bareroot transplants are the most common, but you may also find plug (container) transplants in plastic trays or pots at garden centers.
                        
                        Many growers plant strawberries in raised beds with black plastic mulch for weed control and to keep soil off the berries. Set your transplants through slits in the mulch. Make sure you do not cover the crowns of transplants.</h5>
